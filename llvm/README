SlackBuild script aiming to build llvm for Slackware ARM.
Installing modules clang, lld, compiler-rt and aiming targets
ARM,X86 and AArch64 as it's not likely one will be using a Raspberry Pi to crosscompile to any other architectures.
The script is designed to suit my slackbuild for chromium that i adopted from AlienBOB
in order to be able to compile chromium/chromium-ungoogled for Slackware ARM on a Rasberry Pi
and not having to compile llvm/clang every time (Saves about atleast 12 hours of compiling time).

This script installs the llvm/clang toolchain to /opt/llvm.

Update: As Slackware Arm 15.0 was released, lld was added to system pacakage llvm.
However Chromium >= 104 now requiers clang version 16.
As Chromium does not allow to build llvm for 32-bit systems i made this slackbuild.

Chromium 137 >= now requiers minimum clang version 20.
It's not possible to build clang 20.x with gcc or clang 13.x (clang version in Slackware 15.0)
So the work around that i came up with, was to build clang and lld version 18.x with Slackware 15.0 system clang (Version 13.x).
Why use system clang to compile clang? Well because building with gcc broke in clang 12.
So i created a Slackbuild called llvm-bootstrap to make this easier.
