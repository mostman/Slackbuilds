SlackBuild script aiming to build llvm for Slackware ARM.
Installing modules clang, lld, clang-tools-extra, compiler-rt and aiming targets
ARM,X86 and AArch64 as it's not likely one will be using a Raspberry Pi 
to crosscompile to any other architectures.
The script is designed to suit my slackbuild for chromium that i adopted from AlienBOB
in order to be able to compile chromium/chromium-ungoogled for Slackware ARM on a Rasberry Pi
and not having to compile llvm/clang every time (Saves about six hours of compiling time).

This script installs the llvm/clang toolchain to /opt/llvm.

Update: As Slackware Arm 15.0 was released, lld was added to system pacakage llvm, so its no need to build llvm any more.
