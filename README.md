llvm/clang package Compiled for Slackware ARM 15.0 (RPI 4), note: Chromiums internal llvm takes about 6-8 hours to compile, so to speed up the process i built latest llvm-16.0.x to be able to build chromium/ungoogled > 104.  
This will most likley not be needed as Slacware aarch64 alredy has llvm/clang 16.0.6 installed in the system
