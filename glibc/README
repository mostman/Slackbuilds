Before we start and to avoid any errors like:
  "parsetexi/Parsetexi.c: loadable library and perl binaries are mismatched (got first handshake key 0xf180080, needed 0xf980080)"
So in this case it was there was some issue with the package "texinfo-7.0.3-x86_64-2.txz".
Solution was to uninstall the package and download the package directly from "https://slackware.uk/slackwarearm/slackwareaarch64-current/slackware/ap/".
Because if trying to reinstall the package i recived a checksum error...Might have courht this package just been updated..i dont know why...
But apparently something went wrong?

We will have to update all perl modules and recompile them.
   # cpan -u

And to recompile them
  # cpan-r

Before we can patch and compile glibc we will have to download and install Stuart WinterÂ´s slackkit-*-aarch64-1.txz.
From here: https://slackware.uk/slackwarearm/slackwareaarch64-current/slackware/d/

And we also have to download slackware64-current/source/l/glibc with rsync

As root
   # cd /usr/src
   # wget https://slackware.uk/slackwarearm/slackwareaarch64-current/slackware/d/slackkit-1.34-aarch64-1.txz
   # installpkg slackkit-1.34-aarch64-1.txz

   # cd /root
   # mkdir -p slackware64-current/source/l/glibc/
   # cd slackware64-current/source/l/glibc/

As we only need and want glibc directory
Sync the Slackware/x86_64 tree for glibc:
   # rsync -Pavv ftp.slackware.org.uk::slackware/slackware64-current/source/l/glibc/ .

   # cd
   # mkdir -p slackwarearm/slackwareaarch64-current/source/l/glibc
   # cd slackwarearm/slackwareaarch64-current/source/l/glibc
   # cp patches/* /root/slackware64-current/source/l/glibc/

And now we can compile glibc
   # ./arm/build
 
Packages will be stored under "/root/tgzstash"
   # cd /root/tgzstash
   # <del>upgradepkg a/aaa_glibc-solibs-2.33-arm-5p1_slack15.0.txz l/glibc-2.33-arm-5p1_slack15.0.txz</del>
 
 And you are all done.
