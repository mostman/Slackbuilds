# Alien Bob´s Chromium slackbuild adopted for Slackware ARM (SARPI Current)
Addopted Alienbob´s Chromium Slackbuild for Slackware ARM SARPI-Current.
so one can compile chromium for your Slackware ARM Rasberry Pi.

This is only built on SARPI Current Rasberry Pi 4.
I have not tried to build this on any other device nore architecture other than ARM.

This is also just a diff patch.

You can download the script from [Alienbobs site]: http://www.slackware.com/~alien/slackbuilds.
And then all you need to do is to patch the [chromium.Slackbuild]: http://www.slackware.com/~alien/slackbuilds/chromium/build/ with this diff.

Might also want to add the patches from the patch directory.
